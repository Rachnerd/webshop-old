## Intro

To spare you the tedious work of creating a new TS service that interacts with a new API, I've provided the code. Observe
the changes to see how you can add new dependencies to the `ServerContext`. In a later assignment you're expected to do
the same for a different service.

[PricesService commit](https://github.com/Rachnerd/webshop/commit/939c9a5a2c772e6a7af2d5375668fbd67a69938e)

In this assignment we'll learn what happens if due to new requirements the item price has to be retrieved from a different
endpoint using a `Type Resolver`.

## Assignments

### 2.1 Item resolver

- Create a `price` resolver for `Item` and call the `PricesService` with the id of the item.

Hint:

- [Resolver chains](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#resolver-chains)

Open the [playground](http://localhost:4000) and execute the following query:

```graphql
{
  items(paging: { page: 0, size: 6 }) {
    page
    size
    totalResults
    content {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Observe the logs of the running NextJS server. You should see that `/api/prices/{id}` is called 6 times. We have just
introduced the N+1 problem.

### 2.2 Solving the N+1 problem

[DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) is a GraphQL tool that solves the N+1 problem. Instead of directly
calling APIs, calling DataLoader allows you to batch requests instead of firing them individually.

Here's an endpoint you can use to batch prices:

```typescript
  async getByIds(ids: number[]): Promise<number[]> {
    return fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/prices?ids=${ids.join(",")}`).then((res) =>
      res.json()
    );
  }
```

- Implement a `DataLoader<number, number>` for price inside the `PricesService` and make sure the N+1 problem is solved.

Hint:

- Here's an example of
  DataLoader in TypeScript:

```typescript
type Input = any; // Whatever your requests needs
type Output = any; // Whatever you expect in return

const myDataLoader = new DataLoader<Input, Output>(
  async (inputCollection: Input[]) => {
    // batch impl
    return [] as Output[]; // Output order should match input order
  }
);

// Here's a call to dataloader with just an id
myDataLoader.load(id); // batch function will receive: (ids: string[])

// Here's a call to dataloader with paging
myDataLoader.load({ page, size }); // batch function will receive: (pagings: GQLPagingParams[])
```

- BONUS: Make DataLoader only call the batch endpoint if it has to fetch multiple prices. If only one price is needed
  call the original `getById` endpoint.

Open the [playground](http://localhost:4000) and execute the following query:

```graphql
{
  items(paging: { page: 0, size: 6 }) {
    page
    size
    totalResults
    content {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Observe the logs of the running NextJS server. You should see that `/api/prices` is called once.

BONUS: Query only 1 item and see if NextJS logs `/api/prices/{id}` is called once.
